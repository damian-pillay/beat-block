# File Upload Security

This section outlines key risks and defenses related to file upload features, including how attackers exploit them and how to secure uploads through validation and safe handling.

# Notes

### **What Are File Upload Vulnerabilities?**

File upload vulnerabilities occur when a web server allows users to upload files without adequately validating their name, type, contents, or size. This can enable attackers to upload malicious files, such as server-side scripts, leading to remote code execution. In some cases, just uploading the file causes harm; in others, the file must be accessed via a URL to trigger the exploit.

### **Impact of File Upload Vulnerabilities**

The severity of file upload vulnerabilities depends on several factors:

- **Validation Failures**: Improper validation of file size, type, or contents can allow malicious files to be uploaded.
- **Server Configuration**: If the server executes certain file types (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`), an attacker could upload a web shell and gain full control over the server.
- **Filename Handling**: Lack of proper filename validation can lead to overwriting critical files or uploading to unintended directories (e.g., using directory traversal).
- **Resource Consumption**: Uploading large files without restrictions can exhaust server resources, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### **How Do File Upload Vulnerabilities Arise?**

Although many sites implement validation, these measures are often flawed:

- **Flawed File Type Validation**: Relying solely on file extensions or MIME types can be bypassed.
- **Insufficient Blacklisting**: Blacklists may miss certain dangerous file types or bypass variants.
- **Obfuscated File Extensions**: Techniques like double extensions (`image.jpg.php`) or Unicode tricks can bypass filters.
- **Race Conditions**: Exploiting timing gaps between file upload and validation can enable attackers to sneak in malicious files.

### **Exploitation Techniques**

- **Web Shell Uploads**: Uploading scripts that execute on the server to provide remote access.
- **Client-Side Script Uploads**: Uploading scripts that execute in the user's browser.
- **Parsing Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting how the server interprets uploaded file data.
- **PUT Method Abuse**: Direct file upload via HTTP PUT requests when improperly enabled.

### **Prevention Strategies**

### **Prevention Strategies**

- **Use a whitelist of allowed file extensions**  
  Only allow specific, known-safe extensions. A whitelist is much more secure than trying to blacklist malicious ones.

- **Validate file names**  
  Ensure the filename does not contain directory traversal patterns (e.g., `../`) or unusual characters that could manipulate paths.

- **Rename uploaded files**  
  Automatically rename uploaded files to avoid overwriting existing files or executing arbitrary scripts with predictable names.

- **Store uploads outside the web root**  
  Uploaded files should not be accessible directly via the web server. This prevents attackers from accessing uploaded malicious files.

- **Use secure file storage**  
  Do not move uploaded files to the permanent filesystem until all validation checks have passed.

- **Limit file types by content (MIME/sniffing)**  
  Check that the file’s actual content matches its extension/MIME type to prevent disguised files.

- **Set appropriate permissions on uploaded files**  
  Ensure uploaded files are not executable and have the minimal permissions required.

- **Scan files with antivirus**  
  Use antivirus or other malware detection tools to inspect uploaded content before accepting it.

- **Avoid writing custom validation logic**  
  Use well-established libraries or frameworks for upload handling and validation to minimize errors or missed edge cases.

- **Limit file size and upload frequency**  
  Implement file size limits and rate-limiting to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via excessive or large uploads.

## Thoughts

It seems that allowing file uploads introduces an entirely new set of vulnerabilities, but with careful planning, these can be mitigated. One of the most notable threats is web shell uploads — if successful, this would give an attacker full access to the server. However, this risk can be reduced by disallowing the execution of uploaded files. In fact, I can prevent malicious files from being uploaded entirely by creating a whitelist of allowed file types, which is viable since I already know which file types I want to permit. Another risk is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which could occur if a hacker uploads large files without restriction, potentially exhausting server resources. This can be mitigated easily by restricting the file upload size. Additionally, since users may want to upload multiple projects at once, I may need to limit the number of projects that can be uploaded within a certain time period.

File validation is also critically important. It is recommended to use a well-established library or framework for upload handling and validation to minimize errors. While there are many additional techniques I could implement, some may be overkill for demo purposes. I will need to decide what to implement for the MVP (09/05/2025)
