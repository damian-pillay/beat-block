# File Upload Strategies

This section outlines common methods and best practices for handling file uploads in web applications. It covers techniques for sending files from the frontend to the backend, storing them efficiently, and managing scalability and performance across different use cases.

# Notes

### Standard `multipart/form-data` Upload

**Description**  
Files are uploaded from the frontend using `FormData` and sent to the backend via HTTP POST. The backend handles file parsing (e.g., with `multer`) and uploads it to Azure Blob Storage.

**Pros**

- Simple and widely supported.
- Good for small to moderate file sizes (up to 50–100MB).
- Works with traditional HTML forms and JavaScript.

**Cons**

- Entire file may be buffered in memory or temp storage.
- Not ideal for large files due to memory constraints.

**Best For**

- Basic file upload forms.
- MVPs and admin panels handling small files.

**Scalability**: Moderate  
**Deployment Readiness**: Good

### Streaming Upload to Blob via Backend

**Description**  
Files are streamed from frontend to backend, and the backend streams them directly into blob storage without loading the entire file into memory.

**Pros**

- Efficient and scalable for large files.
- Low memory usage on the backend.
- Allows processing files on the fly.

**Cons**

- Requires libraries that support streaming.
- Slightly more complex to implement.

**Best For**

- Apps dealing with large files like audio/video.
- Production systems with limited backend memory.

**Scalability**: High  
**Deployment Readiness**: Excellent

### Chunked or Resumable Uploads

**Description**  
Frontend splits files into smaller parts and uploads each chunk individually. The backend reassembles them or stores them using Azure Block Blob APIs.

**Pros**

- Supports uploads of very large files (hundreds of MB to GB).
- Can resume uploads after failure.
- Enables parallel chunk uploads for speed.

**Cons**

- Complex implementation on frontend and backend.
- Requires tracking upload state, chunk order, and offset.

**Best For**

- Large media files or unreliable networks.
- Power users who need resumable uploads.

**Scalability**: Very High  
**Deployment Readiness**: Advanced

### Direct Upload to Blob via SAS (Pre-signed URLs)

**Description**  
Frontend requests a secure, time-limited SAS (Shared Access Signature) URL from the backend and uploads directly to blob storage.

**Pros**

- Offloads all file handling from your backend.
- Extremely scalable.
- Backend doesn’t handle the file content.

**Cons**

- Requires secure SAS token generation.
- More difficult to monitor or validate uploads.

**Best For**

- Production-grade apps expecting high volume.
- Scenarios where performance and cost-efficiency matter.

**Scalability**: Very High  
**Deployment Readiness**: Excellent
