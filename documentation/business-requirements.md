## Business Requirements

### Objective

Create a centralized application for storing and managing music DAW projects, allowing users to tag and organize projects using metadata.

### Target Audience

- Music producers, composers, and sound designers who use DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) and need an easy way to store, organize, and tag their projects.

### Key Stakeholders

- **You (Damian)** – As the primary user, your goal is to have all your music projects accessible in one place.
- **Future Users** – Others who may also want to store and organize their music projects in a similar way.

### Business Goals

- **Goal 1**: Centralize all music DAW projects in one easily accessible location.
- **Goal 2**: Enable efficient organization through metadata tagging.
- **Goal 3**: Create a simple, easy-to-use interface for managing projects.

## Core Functionality

### Features

1. **Project Storage**: Store music projects in a central location with support for different file types (e.g., project files, audio files, etc.).
2. **Metadata Tagging**: Allow the user to tag each project with customizable metadata (e.g., genre, date created, instruments used).
3. **Search and Filter**: Implement search functionality to allow users to search for projects by tags or keywords.
4. **Project Organization**: Create folders or categories to group related projects for easy access.

### User Flow

1. **Add New Project**: The user can add a new project by uploading project files, and metadata (tags) can be added at the time of upload or after.
2. **Organize Projects**: The user can organize projects by categorizing them in folders or assigning tags.
3. **Search and Filter**: The user can search for projects by tags, date, or keywords and filter by categories.

## User Stories

- **As a User**, I want to be able to add new music projects to the app, so that I can store them in a centralized location.
- **As a User**, I want to tag my projects with metadata like genre or instruments, so that I can easily find them later.
- **As a User**, I want to be able to search and filter my projects by metadata, so that I can quickly locate a specific project.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- The application should allow for easy access to stored projects and quick search/filter functionality.

### Security

- The application should ensure data privacy and protect user-uploaded files.

### Usability

- The interface should be simple, intuitive, and accessible, even for users who are not tech-savvy.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

- The application will initially be used by you (Damian) for your personal projects, with the potential for future use by others.
- You will be using a combination of cloud storage and local file storage for the project files.

### Constraints

- The initial version will be kept simple, with the ability to upload and organize projects and metadata.
- The project should be flexible enough to accommodate future expansion of features (e.g., sharing projects, versioning).
